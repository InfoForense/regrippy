Plugin test coverage
====================

Here is a recap of which plugins are properly tested, and which are not. Ideally, we should
strive for 100% coverage :-)

To make this dream a reality, please attach a test file to your pull requests! This way, the 
percentage at least won't go down.

**Current percentage: 91%**
